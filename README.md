# Basic.css
Reduce the amount of unique CSS properties by establishing a cross-browser compatible CSS system for commonly used properties.

## How does it work?
Basic.css groups together commonly used HTML tags (e.g. body,h1, h5, span, button, input, ::selection, ect.) to establish fundemental controls such as Themes, Font Sizing, Form Contruction, Links, Highlights and more. This establishes the ground work so commonly used CSS can be quickly modified with one or two properties at the start of the document. The changes are then applied instantly through CSS inheritance. 

## Is Basic.css for you?
Basic.css establishes a CSS foundation between the browser's user-agent and your framework. Basic.css is like Normalize.css and Reset CSS, except they are not designed to be editable while Basic.css is. Basic.css is a boilerplate ready to be customized to fit your needs. 

Basic.css is for you if:
* Your framework or stylesheet has no foundation on basic selectors (div, button, input, ::selection).
* You desire control over basic selectors
* Your starting a CSS framework from scratch.

Basic.css is not for you if:
* You are using Bootstrap or another framework which already has a foundation built on basic selectors.
* You don't desire control over basic selectors.

## Development
Basic.css is designed to aid the development of websites and webapps through simplicity. To develop for this project requires no prerequsites. Just knowledge of raw CSS.
